# OOP Term Project - Bank System

This project was developed as part of the *Object-Oriented Programming* (OOP) course.

It implements a full-featured bank system in C++, supporting the following functionalities:
- Creation of banks
- Creation and management of accounts
- Deposit and withdrawal operations
- Inter-bank transactions (e.g., transfers between different banks)

All features are fully managed within the C++ application, demonstrating core object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
